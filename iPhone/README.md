## iPhone Model

This project was proposed as a part of Santander & DIO's Java Bootcamp. It simply represents an iPhone and some of its most-used apps. This project was not designed for actual execution, but to exercise abstraction and POO concepts.

## UML Diagram
All the classes, attributes, and methods were represented in a UML Diagram, which can be visualized in the "iPhoneModel.drawio" file.
