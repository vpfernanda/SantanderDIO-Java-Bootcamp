## Conta Banco
This little project was implemented in order to practice basic POO Java's concepts. The application basically gets two inputs from the user, as the agency number and one's full name. After that, an object is created through the class constructor (the account number is a randomly generated 5 digit number and the balance is initialized as zero, by default).

## Main Goals
Using Java.util.scanner to get user inputs; Practicing basic POO's concepts; Familiarizing to Java Syntax.
