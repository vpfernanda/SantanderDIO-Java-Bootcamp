## Controle-Fluxo
This project was proposed as a part of Santander &DIO's Java Backend Bootcamp. The application gets two inputs from the user, which must be integer values (if not, the user is advised, then an Exception is thrown and caught). Also, the second integer must be greater than the first (again, if not, the user is advised, then an Exception is thrown and caught). If everything goes right, the program will output a counter from 1 to the difference between the inputs.

## Main Goals
To practice Exceptions and iterations.
