# Digital Bank
This activity was proposed as a part of Santander &DIO's Java Bootcamp. The main task is to implement an application that represents a digital bank with its main features (as deposit, withdrawal, etc).
This project means to exercise the POO concepts, such as abstraction, polymorphism, and class hierarchy.

## Adicional Features
In this implementation, the list of banks is saved in a .txt file, the database for a TreeMap containing the Banks. Each bank has a reference key, which can be used in the Account constructor to create a bank account. 

## Next Steps
For now, the application does just basic operations, such as: creating an account, adding a bank to the map, saving the map in the .txt file, and doing the account balance's operations. The main goal of this project was to exercise POO's concepts simply, but, I intend to make this project better as I learn more about Java.
