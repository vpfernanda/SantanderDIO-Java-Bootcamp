Repository created to store the files used during my learning journey in Java BackEnd Bootcamp provided by Santander &amp; Digital Innovation One's partnership. This repository is for educational purposes only.

  

# Projects developed along the course

## Conta-Banco
This project was made as an exercise to practice Java Syntax. It was proposed as a part of Dio&Santander's Java Backend Bootcamp. 

## CPF Validator
This project was developed as an exercise to practice the concept of Exceptions in Java. The brazilian CPF has some mathematical rules that makes it valid. The application, then, gets a CPF from the user (which must contain only numbers) and make the validation through it's digits and returns if it is valid or not. 

## Controle-Fluxo
This project was proposed as a part of Santander &DIO's Java Backend Bootcamp. The application gets two inputs from the user, which must be integer values (if not, the user is advised, then an Exception is thrown and caught). Also, the second integer must be greater than the first (again, if not, the user is advised, then an Exception is thrown and caught). If everything goes right, the program will output a counter from 1 to the difference between the inputs.
